It has the following features:
*Word frequency analysis.
*Sentiment analysis.

Word frequency analysis ===> lists the words with their frequency starting from the highest to the lowest

Sentiment Analysis ===>  is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.
    
The AlchemyAPI is used for sentiment analysis.

 AlchemyAPI's sentiment analysis ===> algorithm looks for words that carry a positive or negative connotation then figures out which person, place or thing they are referring to. It also understands negations.

The following are the three parameters for each analysis:

-mixed	(1) indicates that the sentiment is both positive and negative

-score	    Sentiment strength (0.0 == neutral)

-type	    Sentiment polarity: positive, negative, or neutral
